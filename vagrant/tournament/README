Udacity Nanodegree - Full Stack Developer 
Project #2 Tournament


How to run/test ?
Run $ python tournament_test.py


Extra Note:
I have added two extra test-routines in tournament_test.py: 
testReportMatches_8players() and testPairings_8players_3rounds()
The purpose of these new routines is to test 8 players and 3 rounds test-cases.

I have left the two original test-routines (testReportMatches() and testPairings())
as it is, for two intentions: 
(a) The original routines present simpler, smaller test data for developer with 
    beginner-level skills to deal with  
(b) Not pollute already tested test-routines with new code/logic


Project Status At The Time of Submissions:
All tests-cases (original and the new ones introduced by me) passes.

Extra Credit Implementations: 
None

Thanks
